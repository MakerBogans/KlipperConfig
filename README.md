Klipper Printer Configuration Files by bogans for bogans

Here is a place where we can store our printer configurations, so they can be revision controlled, backed up, and reverted.

Some of them are beautiful and would make for great examples for people just starting out in printing

Others of them were made by three ducks in a trenchcoat.

How do we rate them as which are worthy of liberating?


Also also, if we are making this place public, we really should have a license.
Voron Devs use GPL3
SittingDuc likes CC-BY-SA-3.0 for no real reason

Cheers!
